# Iris_Flower_Classification
IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION  This is one of the most famous machine learning projects with Iris Flowers being the simplest machine learning datasets in classification literature. The dataset has numeric attributes and ML beginners need to figure out how to load and handle data. The iris dataset is small which easily fits into the memory and does not require any special transformations or scaling, to begin with.  This machine learning project aims to classify the flowers into among the three species â€“ Virginia, setosa, or Versicolor based on the length and width of petals and sepals.
